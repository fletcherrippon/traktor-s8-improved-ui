### Why is Traktor Pro 3 crashing when I connect my S8

This means something went wrong while installing the updated UI or something is wrong with the code.

If this happens you can shut down Traktor Pro 3 and use copy and paste the backed up files back into the application files.

- Windows: C:\Program Files\Native Instruments\Traktor Pro 3\Resources64\qml

Then start up Traktor Pro 3 and if backed up files are installed corrently you will be back to the orignal S8 UI.

If you belive this is an issue with the code post an issue on this repo.
